## Milestone 2a Feedback
Your Milestone 2a looks pretty good! Your content strategy is pretty simple - you can just have one content strategy since your content will ideally be the same on both desktop and mobile, but yours are the same so it works. There's not a lot of different between your mobile and desktop wireframes, which is okay because you want them to be similar, but keep in mind for design on mobile that everything will be bigger, and you'll probably only want one photo visible in a carousel of photos for your photos of dogs, for example.

Otherwise your wireframes are good and simple and your HTML looks pretty good. Remember to put text inside of the p tags, it looks like you meant to but just didn't finish, and you can put everything you have in your milestone-2 index.html straight into the milestone-2.php file.

Your Milestone 2a passes at a Tier III. You are free to begin working on your PWP!
