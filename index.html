		<p style="color:white;">Fact: Proof that dogs are man's best friend
			"Man's best friend" is a common phrase about domestic dogs, referring to their millennia-long
			history of close relations, loyalty, and companionship with humans.
			The first recorded use of a related phrase is by Frederick the Great of Prussia.</p>
		<p style="color:white;">Often when we think of friendship, the word loyalty comes to the forefront as a very
			important and desired character trait in a friend.  A loyal friend is a friend who never lets you down.

			I think that a story about friendship cannot be without a story about man’s most loyal and trusted friend—the dog!</p>

		<p style="color:green;">If you love dogs, you're like many of us who feel like we can't live without them.
			That's not surprising, considering dogs have been companions to humans for the past 30,000 years.
